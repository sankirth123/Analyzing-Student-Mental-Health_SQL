In 2018, a Japanese international university conducted a student survey, and the findings were published the following year after receiving approval from multiple ethical and regulatory bodies.
The study revealed that international students are more susceptible to mental health challenges compared to the general population. It also identified two key predictors of depression: social connectedness (the sense of belonging to a social group) and acculturative stress (the psychological strain of adapting to a new cultural environment).

Insights Highlights:

1. Acculturative Stress Drives Depression: 
Students experiencing higher cultural adjustment stress report significantly more depressive symptoms.

2. Social Connectedness Is Protective:
Strong peer relationships and a sense of belonging correlate with lower depression scores.

3. International Students Face Elevated Risks:
Compared to domestic peers, international students show
Higher depression and acculturative stress & Lower social connectedness
These effects are strongest early in their stay.

4. Time and Language Ease the Burden:
Longer stay duration and better local language skills help reduce stress and improve mental health outcomes.

5. Interaction Effects Matter: 
Social connectedness buffers the impact of stress on depression. The negative effects of acculturative stress diminish over time
